I recently started to rebuild my website with SvelteKit, and felt nostalgic about  websites I had built earlier.

## Early Days

In primary school a friend introduced me to this drag and drop website maker that made a personal website similar to a MySpace/Bebo profile, but it had no structure and looked wildly different between users. Unfortunately I can't remember the name of the site, but I do remember my one was filled with pictures of Pokemon.

Around the same time, I was addicted to the Ninja Warz and Restaurant City games on Facebook. I eventually created a wiki/guide website using Yolasite which is like a website creator similar to Wix and SquareSpace. The urls were `ninjawarz.yolasite.com` and `restaurantcity-guide.yolasite.com`. I actually did get more traffic than I was expecting, and had people on the forums and emails suggesting improvements, but when the games shut down on Facebook, I deleted them. I'm still a bit bummed I didn't archive them for the memories ðŸ˜­.

At the time I also tried making websites for Maplestory private servers, but didn't really understand content management systems enough to do it. I was mainly downloading a CMS someone else uploaded, changing the names and images around and  embedding a `xat.com` chat on the home page. I also set up some forums for 'clans' on the online Yu-Gi-Oh game `duelingnetwork.com` using Forumotion.

## For School Subjects

In high school we had a web programming class where I actually started to learn how the web works. I learnt PHP and HTML, and we were using Eclipse. For my final project I made a static website about the paleo diet, and outside of class I made a website with user input that calculated things for the online game Maplestory. When I started university I deleted all files relating school which I regret.

I did a single web development unit in university, but I didn't really learn much. The final assignment was to take a template, change the content and add a prebuilt js component. I designed mine around a friend's band, and actually spent so much time on it, designing fake album covers and articles. I only got a credit and was so peeved. It used to be hosted on `yzalvin.github.io/band`.

## For Fun

I'd built a lot of React apps at this point, mocking a backend and creating a frontend SPA. The 2 projects I had the most fun working on were with:

1. Using the PokeApi to make a PokeDex kind of site, because I like Pokemon ðŸ˜‡.
2. Scraping brands off the Nestle website to make something like `Buycott.com`, because I'd seen some anti-nestle campaigns.

My personal website has gone over 4 iterations on `yzalvin.github.io`. I used to delete repos because I was embarassed so I don't have the older versions of my website anymore, but I've decided to keep any older iterations on a branch or a separate repo from now on. My first 2 versions I used a template and just changed the content and colour scheme. Version 3 was built using Ruby and Jekyll. I mainly used it to keep notes about the things I was learning in my graduate program. I didn't really like the way it looked, and it was too hard for me to customise, so I decided I would try to write one from scratch, now that I'd had a lot of experience from work.

I was pretty familiar with React, but I wanted to try something different. If I use React at work, I could learn something else outside of work. The only reason I chose Svelte over Angular or Vue was because my Youtube recommendations were popping off with Svelte videos.

## Conclusion

My biggest regret has been deleting my work instead of archiving it. I wish I could go back and try to make them better, knowing what I know now.

Thanks for reading! :-)
