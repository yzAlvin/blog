I've stumbled across many tech blogs, and always found it interesting to read about someone's opinions/experiences. I was particularly amazed by [Project Nayuki](https://nayuki.io). I was already writing my notes in Markdown, and after attending a technical writing bootcamp I figure I could try my own.

Hopefully by writing these I am able to convey my thoughts clearer, and get better at explaining things. It might also be a great place for me solidify my knowledge, by writing it down and having something to refer to.

This place will probably become a dumping ground for whatever I want, but I'm hopeful someone will glean something from a post. I'll pretend this space is like CreedThoughts or Bob Loblaw's Law Blog ðŸ¤ª.
